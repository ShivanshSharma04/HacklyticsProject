"Here's a preview of the story:
From baguettes to focaccia, Europe is famous for its bread. But there's one ingredient conspicuously missing: Potassium bromate. It's a suspected carcinogen that's banned for human consumption in Europe, China and India, but not in the United States.
In the U.S., the chemical compound is used by some food makers, usually in the form of fine crystals or powder, to strengthen dough. It is estimated to be present in more than 100 products.
""There is evidence that it may be toxic to human consumers, that it may even either initiate or promote the development of tumors,"" professor Erik Millstone, an expert on food additives at England's University of Sussex, told CBS News. He said European regulators take a much more cautious approach to food safety than their U.S. counterparts.
Asked if it can be said with certainty that differences in regulations mean people in the U.S. have developed cancers that they would not have developed if they'd been eating exclusively in Europe, Millstone said that was ""almost certainly the conclusion that we could reach.""
It's not just potassium bromate. A range of other chemicals and substances banned in Europe over health concerns are also permitted in the U.S., including Titanium dioxide (also known as E171); Brominated vegetable oil (BVO) (E443); Potassium bromate (E924); Azodicarbonamide (E927a) and Propylparaben (E217).

In children whose brains are still developing, the brain adds the functions of the areas missing to the area remaining - our hemispheres are mostly the same and are connected by tissue called the corpus callosum, though each side does have some specific roles (which is called hemispheric lateralization), and each side controls the movement for the opposing side (her right hemisphere was disconnected, so her left side will take some time to be controlled by the left hemisphere). This type of plasticity is most effective around 0-5 but can occur past that time frame, so they've done it at a great time in her lifespan. Alternatively, had she not had this surgery, her right hemisphere will have begun to shrink further and led to physical, cognitive and intellectual disabilities (such as learning difficulties and paralysis)."", 'I assume they expect the body to adapt.', ""There's an episode on Greys Anatomy with a younger child that gets the same thing, and an episode of House with an adult dude that got one done, I don't know how 'real' they are but the concept is awesome!\nGrey's Anatomy season 1 episode 7\nHouse MD season 5 episode 24"", 'It‚Äôs because of neuroplasticity.\nBasically, the half that‚Äôs still online will take on the functions of the disconnected half.', 'A friend growing up had this surgery but not until she began having daily, recurring seizures around age 13.

A researcher says one person in Ohio is shedding massive amounts of a new kind of COVID. Identifying people with mysterious strains can help scientists to preempt dangerous mutations. Top editors give you the stories you want ‚Äî delivered right to your inbox each weekday.\nEarlier this year, Marc Johnson, a professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the University of Missouri School of Medicine, took to Twitter with an appeal: ""Help me solve a COVID cryptic lineage mystery.""\nJohnson told Insider that he was looking through a database of COVID samples when he came across a brand-new version, or ""lineage,"" of the virus. There were massive amounts of this unique strain, all coming from one mystery person in Ohio.\nThe viral material has been primarily found at two sites: The city of Columbus and 40 miles away in the city of Washington Court House ‚Äî Johnson says the person may live in one city and work in the other.\nHe says that this isn\'t ""an imminent public-health threat,"" and that the person likely has a form of ""long COVID"" that isn\'t contagious.\nBut finding these lineages, and identifying the people who spread them, could unlock new clues into how COVID mutates as well as why some people become super-shedders of the virus for long periods.\n""Cryptic"" COVID lineages show how the virus can mutate in new ways\nJohnson told Insider that he had been identifying ""cryptic"" COVID lineages in wastewater nationwide since 2021. These strains ""don\'t match anything we\'ve seen before,"" he said, adding that SARS-CoV-2 still had some tricks up its sleeve and plenty we didn\'t know.\nWhile these cryptic strains have only been identified in wastewater, they could be harbingers of future variants. Long before Omicron emerged, researchers were collecting samples of COVID that they didn\'t recognize ‚Äî cryptic lineages that we now understand to be similar to Omicron, according to a preprint paper ‚Äî not-yet-peer-reviewed ‚Äî published last month by Johnson and his team.\nThe first cryptic-COVID lineage Johnson found in 2021 was a classic example of his discoveries. There was so much virus in the wastewater that he thought it was coming from a nursing home or maybe an animal reservoir like a dog shelter. But his team traced it to a single office building in Wisconsin with about 30 employees, they wrote in the preprint paper.\n""I didn\'t believe a person could shed that much,"" Johnson said.\nThe workers in the building were notified and were able to get tested.

I worked at a rheumatology clinic and the doctor stopped prescribing methotrexate to young women, as she knew this was going to happen. We are in TX btw', 'I have an online clinic for dermatology that operates in 38 states and is HQd in Texas. We stopped offering accutane (which is specifically mentioned in the article because it cannot be taken by pregnant people) in affected states immediately because we weren‚Äôt sure if we needed to submit proof of non-pregnancy (we already have to ask for it through an archaic and dehumanizing system called I pledge) to government or regulatory bodies and could not find existing HIPAA compliance documentation that outlined a course of action or recourse in that situation. We also had our malpractice insurance premium almost double at renewal. Not to mention, we didn‚Äôt want clinicians or management of the company subjected to possible felony charges if one of our patients happened to be pregnant and happened to miscarry and it could somehow be traced to care that we provided even though the likelihood of that situation is quite low and it‚Äôs otherwise unprecedented.\nWe‚Äôve also now raised questions about acne topicals that have warnings for people who are pregnant. Topical tretinoin is the gold standard clinical treatment for acne and anti-aging, but because vitamin A in high doses (it‚Äôs a topical vitamin A) is associated with birth defects ‚Äî though none have ever actually been observed from topical tret use, it‚Äôs only a theoretical possibility ‚Äî we‚Äôve also had to include rigorous pregnancy testing requirements in some state a where we used to just heavily advise that it should not be used while pregnant or breastfeeding. It makes us look like assholes who can‚Äôt trust our patients to manage and monitor their own health.\nAnd guess what, I‚Äôve lost business and clinicians because of this. Aside from pregnancy testing causing one more layer of friction for our patients, it reduces trust, and it happens to be a very invasive and patronizing requirement. With accutane you have to do monthly blood testing to monitor liver function and this is a lot for some patients, but many of them stick with it. Asking for pregnancy tests for proof of negatives just for topical tret is borderline insulting to people who are able to manage and monitor their health. And sure, treating acne isn‚Äôt life or death care but it matters to our patients who come to us.\nAnd I‚Äôve had the displeasure of talking directly to texas politicians about this. They usually just leave the conversation when I tell them their regulations as administrators of the governing body has limited my ability to do business in the free market. They hate that especially because they can‚Äôt fall back on their talking points about defending the unborn because I don‚Äôt operate in OB or abortive care, I treat acne in non-pregnant women FFS, and they usually have nothing to say about limiting me as a tax paying business owner in the state. Because the third thing these politicians love besides limiting abortion access and proliferating guns is deregulating business.\nAt this point people need to brace themselves for the real possibility that women receiving any and all medical care will have to have a pregnancy test first. And should it come back positive, it will limit the care she‚Äôs given. And even if it comes back negative, simply waiting for the test may have negative outcomes. Again, I‚Äôm not giving life saving care but I can imagine an ER doctor in texas having to order a pregnancy test of a woman who comes in presenting stroke symptoms, or unconscious after a horrific car accident, or having a heart attack before providing care that sometimes comes down to the second because they‚Äôre afraid that if they give a certain blood thinner or anesthesia it could disrupt Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs pregnancy and subject them to criminal prosecution.\nAnd these politicians are trying to masterfully maneuver the system in such a way that the healthcare providers are the bad guys, hoping that you‚Äôll sue them for malpractice or refusal of care because that‚Äôs faster and easier than waiting some number of months or years to vote out the politician that put them in that position, hoping they lose an election, and banking on new politicians rolling back reckless policy. But this doesn‚Äôt solve the problem at hand that most people will be faced with when they are refused care and it takes massive amounts of time and probabilities falling in their favor. Politicians are banking on people being stupid and short sighted or not caring whether anyone else experiences what they went through. But they‚Äôre not, and polling numbers reflect that. But this is what‚Äôs so artful about subjecting providers to prosecution, so now we‚Äôre under threat of malpractice suits by patients that we have to turn away AND threat of felony charges for patients we do treat. And all of this is for care that‚Äôs not even reproductive in nature. It could be anything we have to hesitate on when we don‚Äôt know.
